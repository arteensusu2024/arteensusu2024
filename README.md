👋 Hey, I’m @arteensusu2024, also known as Sofia!

👀 I’m all about web development/design and I’m eager to enhance my skills.

🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into front-end frameworks like React.js and refining my design chops.

💞️ I’m excited to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts on web projects. Let’s team up and create something amazing!

📫 Want to chat? Drop me a line at arenayvida2023@gmail.com or find me on GitHub as @arteensusu2024. Let’s talk code!

😄 Pronouns: She/her (or whatever feels right!)

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you can bet I’m nose-deep in a book. I devour at least one every week!
